# BigO in Javascript Objects, Arrays, etc.

## BigO for Objects

When you do not need ordering in the data then Objects are best choice.

- Operations(insert, remove, access, search) time complexities in **Objects**
  - Insertion: O(1).
  - Removal: O(1).
  - Access: O(1).
  - Searhing: O(n).
    - In below object searching refers to search 94675849 value inside the object. We will be checking for each and evey key to which key 94675849 is assigned.
    ```
    let personalDetails = {
      name: 'pratik',
      age: 27,
      address: 'Gadge Nagar',
      phoneNo: 94675849
    }
    ```
- BigO of Object methods
  - Object.keys: O(n).
  - Object.values: O(n).
  - Object.entries: O(n).
  - hasOwnProperty: O(1).

## BigO for Arrays

- Operations(insert, remove, access, search) time complexities in **Arrays**

  - Insertion
    - At the end: O(1)
    - At the first: O(n) reindexing is going to happen
  - Removal
    - At the end: O(1)
    - At the first: O(n) reindexing is going to happen
  - Searching: O(n).
  - Access: O(1). By giving the index you can get the array element

- BigO of Array methods
  - push: O(1).
  - pop: O(1).
  - shift: O(n).
  - unShift: O(n).
  - concat: O(n).
  - slice: O(n).
  - splice: O(n).
  - sort: O(n\*log(n)).
  - forEach, map, filter, reduce, etc. : O(n).
